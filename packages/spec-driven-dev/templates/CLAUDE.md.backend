# CLAUDE.md - [Your Project Name]

## Project Overview

Build [YOUR PROJECT DESCRIPTION].

**Technology Stack:**
- Language: [.NET 8 / Python 3.12 / Go 1.21 / etc.]
- Framework: [ASP.NET Core / FastAPI / Gin / etc.]
- Database: [PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB / etc.]
- Testing: [xUnit / pytest / go test / etc.]
- CI/CD: [GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / etc.]

**Non-Negotiable Requirements:**
- ✅ Test-first development (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- ✅ ≥90% code coverage enforced
- ✅ Zero tolerance for test failures
- ✅ No skipped tests
- ✅ Quality gates must pass before stage completion

---

## Stage Execution Protocol

### Every Stage: 3 Commands

```bash
# 1. BEFORE: Initialize
./scripts/init-stage.sh --stage X.X --name "Feature Name" --profile BACKEND

# 2. DURING: Implement with TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)

# 3. AFTER: Run gates then complete
./scripts/run-quality-gates.sh --stage X.X 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
./scripts/complete-stage.sh --stage X.X --name "Feature Name"
```

### Context Recovery

```bash
cat stage-proofs/stage-X/.stage-state.yaml
```

## Stage Roadmap

### Stage 1: [Feature Name] 🔴 NOT STARTED
**Goal:** [What you're building]
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Deliverable 1
- [ ] Deliverable 2
- [ ] Deliverable 3

**Success Criteria:**
- All tests passing
- Coverage ≥90%
- Quality gates pass

### Stage 2: [Feature Name] 🔴 NOT STARTED
**Goal:** [What you're building]
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Deliverable 1
- [ ] Deliverable 2

---

## Development Workflow

### TDD Cycle (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)

**For every new feature:**

1. **RED**: Write failing test
2. **GREEN**: Write minimum code to pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
[your test command]

# Run with coverage
[your coverage command]

# Run specific test
[your specific test command]
```

---

## Coding Standards

- [Your code style guidelines]
- [Naming conventions]
- [Architecture patterns]

---

## Quality Gates (Enforced)

### Every Stage Must Pass:
- [ ] Gate 1: No template files
- [ ] Gate 2: Linting passes
- [ ] Gate 3: Build succeeds (0 warnings)
- [ ] Gate 4: Type safety (if applicable)
- [ ] Gate 5: All tests pass (0 failures, 0 skipped)
- [ ] Gate 6: Code coverage ≥90%
- [ ] Gate 7: Security scan (0 vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Gate 8: Proof file complete

**This is your specification. Claude Code reads it and follows it. Quality is enforced, not hoped for.**
