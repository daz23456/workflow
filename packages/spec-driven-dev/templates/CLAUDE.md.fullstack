# CLAUDE.md - [Your Project Name]

## Project Overview

Build [YOUR PROJECT DESCRIPTION].

**Technology Stack:**

### Backend
- Language: [.NET 8 / Node.js / Python / etc.]
- Framework: [ASP.NET Core / Express / FastAPI / etc.]
- Database: [PostgreSQL / MySQL / MongoDB / etc.]
- API: [REST / GraphQL / gRPC]

### Frontend
- Framework: [React / Vue / Angular / Next.js / etc.]
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: [Tailwind CSS / CSS Modules / etc.]
- State: [Redux / Zustand / React Query / etc.]

### Testing
- Backend: [xUnit / Jest / pytest / etc.]
- Frontend: [Vitest / Jest / React Testing Library]
- E2E: [Playwright / Cypress]

### Infrastructure
- CI/CD: [GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / etc.]
- Hosting: [Docker / Kubernetes / Vercel / etc.]

**Non-Negotiable Requirements:**
- ✅ Test-first development (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- ✅ ≥90% code coverage enforced (both frontend and backend)
- ✅ Zero tolerance for test failures
- ✅ No skipped tests
- ✅ Quality gates must pass before stage completion

---

## Stage Execution Protocol

### Every Stage: 3 Commands

```bash
# 1. BEFORE: Initialize
./scripts/init-stage.sh --stage X.X --name "Feature Name" --profile FULLSTACK

# 2. DURING: Implement with TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)

# 3. AFTER: Run gates then complete
./scripts/run-quality-gates.sh --stage X.X 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
./scripts/complete-stage.sh --stage X.X --name "Feature Name"
```

### Context Recovery

```bash
cat stage-proofs/stage-X/.stage-state.yaml
```

## Stage Roadmap

### Stage 1: [Feature Name] 🔴 NOT STARTED
**Goal:** [What you're building]
**Profile:** FULLSTACK
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Backend: [API endpoint]
- [ ] Frontend: [UI component]
- [ ] E2E: [Integration test]

**Success Criteria:**
- All tests passing (backend + frontend + E2E)
- Coverage ≥90% (both layers)
- Quality gates pass

### Stage 2: [Feature Name] 🔴 NOT STARTED
**Goal:** [What you're building]
**Profile:** BACKEND_ONLY / FRONTEND_ONLY
**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Deliverable 1
- [ ] Deliverable 2

---

## Development Workflow

### TDD Cycle (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)

**For every new feature:**

1. **RED**: Write failing test
2. **GREEN**: Write minimum code to pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend && [test command]

# Frontend tests
cd frontend && npm test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# All tests
npm run test:all
```

---

## Coding Standards

### Backend
- [Your backend code style]
- [API naming conventions]
- [Error handling patterns]

### Frontend
- Components: PascalCase, one per file
- Hooks: camelCase, prefix with `use`
- Tests: Co-located with components

### API Contract
- [OpenAPI / GraphQL schema location]
- [Versioning strategy]

---

## Quality Gates (Enforced)

### Every Stage Must Pass:
- [ ] Gate 1: No template files
- [ ] Gate 2: Linting passes (backend + frontend)
- [ ] Gate 3: Build succeeds (0 warnings)
- [ ] Gate 4: Type safety (TypeScript + backend types)
- [ ] Gate 5: All tests pass (0 failures, 0 skipped)
- [ ] Gate 6: Code coverage ≥90% (both layers)
- [ ] Gate 7: Security scan (0 vulnerabilities)
- [ ] Gate 8: Proof file complete

**This is your specification. Claude Code reads it and follows it. Quality is enforced, not hoped for.**
